# Optimisation methods
Implementation of one-dimensional, multi-dimensional optimization methods and conditional optimisation methods.

- `cond_opt_methods.py` - realisation of Kuhn Tucker and external penalty methods
- `methods_opt0.py` - realisation of optimisation methods of the 0th order of a one-dimensional function
- `method_opt1.py` - realisation of optimisation methods of the 1st order of a one-dimensional function
- `method_opt2.py` - realisation of optimisation methods of the 2nd order of a one-dimensional function
- `methods_dim2.py` - realisation of optimisation methods of multi-dimentional functions
